 * Donald Duck works as a postman for the Walt Disney Studios.
 * He delivers childrenâ€™s letters from all over the world to his friends, which are cartoon characters.
 * The Studios has three cases for the letters, with nine sections in each case.
 * Every section has the name of the receiver on it.
 * All cases stand in a row as it is shown at the picture below.
 * Donald Duck have brought n letters today. Initially, he stands near the leftmost case.
 * He has to make one step to go to the neighboring case or to the previous one.
 * How many steps will he make until he puts all the letters into the respective sections,
 *  if he does this in the order they are in his bag?
